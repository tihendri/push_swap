The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.

My goal ? Write 2 programs in C:

• The first, named checker which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on
the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers
are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.

• The second one called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard
output the smallest progam using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

To write a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a coder’s life, because it
is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.

Sorting algorithms, and their complexities are part of the classic questions discussed
during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts because you’ll
have to face them at one point.

The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C and use of basic algorithms.
Especially looking at the complexity of these basic algorithms.

Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple, especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting algorithm
can differ.

Instructions for creating project:

-Global variables are forbidden.
-Your project must be written in C in accordance with the Norm.
-You have to handle errors in a sensitive manner. In no way can your program quit
in an unexpected manner (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).
-Neither program can have any memory leaks.
-Within your mandatory part you are allowed to use the following functions:
◦ write
◦ read
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ exit
